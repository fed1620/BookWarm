NOTES FOR TEAM MEMBERS GO HERE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just heard about xstream - its a library that allows you to pass in an object (even custom objects) and stores it as an XML file. Might make things pretty easy on us for file formatting.

WOO! ListView now displays a book and a title. (Had to make a custom list class) Anyway, Federico, if you need to add books to it, check out the two class variables (String[] titles and Integer[] imageId) in MainActivity.java.
